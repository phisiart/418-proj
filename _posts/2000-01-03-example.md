## A Concrete Example

Before diving into how it works, let's show the TVM OpenGL backend through a concrete example. The explanation is within the comments.

```python
from __future__ import absolute_import, print_function
import tvm
import numpy as np

"""
Step 1. Create a tensor program in Python.
Here we are doing a matrix addition. We use a lambda to specify how
to compute each element of the result matrix. TVM translates this
into an internal abstract syntax tree (AST).
"""
n = tvm.var("n")
A = tvm.placeholder((n, n), name='A')
B = tvm.placeholder((n, n), name='B')
C = tvm.compute(A.shape, lambda i, j: A[i, j] + B[i, j], name="C")

"""
Step 2. Create a TVM "schedule" for the program.
A schedule specifies how to perform loops. For example, in a CUDA
program, you might want to re-arrange loops so that the arrays are
visited by blocks. Here we use our default "opengl" schedule which
maps each output element to a "pixel".
"""
s = tvm.create_schedule(C.op)
s[C].opengl()

"""
Step 3. "Compile" the program according to the schedule.
This step translates the program as well as the schedule into a
piece of GLSL. The "compiled" code is cleanly wrapped around so
that we are left with a normal Python function.
"""
fadd_gl = tvm.build(s, [A, B, C], "opengl", name="myadd")

"""
Step 4. Set up the inputs.
"""
ctx = tvm.opengl(0)
n = 10
a = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=(n, n)).astype(A.dtype), ctx)
b = tvm.nd.array(np.random.uniform(size=(n, n)).astype(B.dtype), ctx)
c = tvm.nd.array(np.zeros((n, n), dtype=C.dtype), ctx)

"""
Step 5. Run the compiled program within Python.
To execute the program, the TVM OpenGL runtime system automatically
- transforms the input matrices into OpenGL textures
- sets up a framebuffer to render to
- launch the GLSL by rendering a square that covers the "screen"
- transforms the output matrix back from OpenGL
"""
fadd_gl(a, b, c)

# Make sure this program is correct.
np.testing.assert_allclose(c.asnumpy(), a.asnumpy() + b.asnumpy())
```

The "compiled" GLSL program for the above example is as follows.

```glsl
#version 330 core
uniform sampler2D A;
uniform sampler2D B;
out float C;
void main() {
  ivec2 threadIdx = ivec2(gl_FragCoord.xy);
  C = (texelFetch(A, ivec2(threadIdx.x, 0), 0).r + texelFetch(B, ivec2(threadIdx.x, 0), 0).r);
}
```
