### Summary

In this project, we

1) Added an OpenGL backend for MXNet/TVM - a general-purpose tensor computation framework, so that it automatically transforms a (limited subset of) Python program into an OpenGL shader that runs on the GPU.

2) Explored optimizations of OpenGL shader programs so that a typical computation task needed in machine learning - matrix multiplication - runs <TODO: how many times?>x faster on GPU than on CPU.
