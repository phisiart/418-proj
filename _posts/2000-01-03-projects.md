## [Research Assistant] Arrow: a DSL for parallel iterative algorithms

I am building a domain-specific language that fits parallel iterative algorithms well. With the DSL, a machine learning algorithm designer doesn't have to turn to large frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, and Parameter Server to test their new algorithms, while still get his / her program parallelized. With ideas borrowed from streaming and modified, the DSL is expressive, and the user would not be limited by any fixed paradigm like MapReduce.

This project is still on going...

## [C Compiler from scratch](https://github.com/phisiart/C-Compiler)

I've built **a complete C compiler from scratch**! It is written in C#, and it supports **all** features in C89, except for bit-fields in structs and the obsolete function declaration syntax.

I **didn't** use any automatic lexer / parser generator ([lex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_(software)), [yacc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc), [antlr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANTLR)...). Instead, I coded the lexer and parser from the ground up all by my self. Having experienced all the verboseness of the handwritten recursive descent parser, I re-wrote it with [parser combinators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator) - yay, functional programming is the best!
<!--
When building and using parser combinators, I found that the most interesting thing is the recursiveness of the C syntax. It won't be too much of a trouble when you just create a function (or method) for each non-terminal. However, when you need to have them as objects (at least function objects), you will have to find a way to get around.-->

I performed semantic analysis - figuring out the type of each expression, analysing the symbol declarations, recognizing semantic errors... all these kinds of stuff.

<!--In this phase, I found some features a little tricky to implement. For example, 1) a struct might contain a pointer which points to a struct of the same type. This is very common in, lets say, linked lists.

```
struct node_t {
    int value;
    struct node_t *next;
};
```-->
<!--
Or, 2) the initialization list. You need to figure out what each element refer to.

```
struct node_t[3][4] = { node0, { 1, NULL }, { 1 } };
```-->

Finally, I generated code into x86 assembly, which can be directly used by gcc's assembler and linker. In this way, I'm able to compare the output with gcc's.

## [[Research Assistant] MicroPython on FPGA](https://github.com/seanzw/MicroPythonFPGA)

In summer 2015, I went to [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/) with [Sean](https://github.com/seanzw), as a research assistant under the supervision of Prof [Peter Cheung](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.cheung).

We ported the [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython), an interpreter specially designed for memory-contrained embedded systems, to an SoC FPGA platform - [Altera De0 Nano SoC](de0-nano-soc.terasic.com/). This interpreter can now run not only on ARM Linux, but also on bare-metal (without any OS support).

We also extended the interpreter with some modules to support peripherals on the board, and perform communication between HPS and FPGA. From the examples we've built, we found that writing python on this chip could be such an enjoyable experience compared to C!

## [Research Assistant] Sketch-based shape retrieval

I worked at the CG lab of the CS department on a project to use human-drawn sketches to query 3D models from a database. My contributions to this project include:

* I implemented the real-time curve fitting algorithm: as the user draws the sketch, I recognize lines and bezier curves. The user might draw a corner, and I must correctly cut the curve into different segments.

* I recognized lines and ellipses in rendered pictures of models.

* Based on lines and ellipses, I recognized polygon primitives.

## [Mirror: an AI contest platform](https://github.com/phisiart/ds15gl)

There is an anual departmental programming contest, where competitors write AI programs to fight against each other in a game. I was in the platform developing team for the fall 2013 contest. I built the 3D game scene using OpenGL in C++ **from the ground up, without using any game engines**.

Without the help of a game engine, I had to solve a lot of problems: load model and image files by reading bits and bytes (yes, I even didn't use a image library, and loaded bmp files just in C++), set up the skybox, set up lighting effects, figure out all those transformation matrices, and implement animations. I also built a simple UI.

I built a lot of wheels in this projects - great practicing experience, though not necessarily the best choice in production.

Later, I recruited the best students in our department to form a group for developing the platform for the competition in the next year, and suggested that they use Unity3D. They did so, and the visual effects improved dramatically!
