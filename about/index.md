Hi, I am Johnson Tan, a current undergraduate student at Tsinghua University, China.

## Projects
* ### Other secret projects...

* ### [My own C Compiler](https://github.com/phisiart/C-Compiler)

  I'm writing my own C compiler! It'll be a **REAL** compiler that translates ISO C code to 32-bit x86 assembly code. The compiler is still under construction.

* ### Brain network display platform

  The NICS lab at Tsinghua EE department was doing some work on accelerating calculations of brain data. I built a simple brain viewer for them.

* ### Student Research Training: Monte Carlo Ray Tracing

  In my sophomore year, I signed up for a 'Student Research Training' project, which turned out to be more like another small class. I learned and implemented the Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithm. This doesn't seem a very difficult task now, but it was pretty challenging back then since I had not systematically studied computer graphics.

* ### ['Mirror', A programming contest platform](https://github.com/phisiart/ds15gl) | 2013.7 - 2013.12

  There is an annual programming contest in Tsinghua EE department, where students write AI code to compete in a game. The game is designed and built all by students.
  
  I was in the 2013 develop team and built the 3D game scene with vanilla OpenGL on C++. I didn't use any game engine.

  Making something like this purely with OpenGL is pretty badass, right?
